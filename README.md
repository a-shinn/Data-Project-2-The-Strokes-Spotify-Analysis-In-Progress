# Data Project 2 - Analysis of The Strokes' Spotify data

Repository for my data project to analyze Spotify data for The Strokes.

The goal of this project is to continue gaining familiarity with Python by pulling API data from Spotify, with a focus on creating compelling visualizations from current data (final result should be something along the lines of a script that, when run, produces a file with up-to-date data as well as visualizations)

Tableau Visualizations (VERY in-progress):
